A repository of executables and python classes based on the Bishop (1999) radiative transport codes used in the Gallant et al. (2019) JGR paper (2018JA026426).

### [LYAO_RT-python-lib](https://github.com/lenses-lab/LYAO_RT-2018JA026426/tree/master/LYAO_RT-python-lib)
This includes several python classes and scripts for running, parsing, and plotting LYAO_RT.

### [LYAO_RT](https://github.com/lenses-lab/LYAO_RT-2018JA026426/tree/master/LYAO_RT)
This is a clean copy of the executables and shell script for running LYAO_RT using NRLMSISE-00 as the thermospheric input. Also included are examples of input and output files naming structure.

### [Shadow](https://github.com/lenses-lab/LYAO_RT-2018JA026426/tree/master/Shadow)
This is a copy of the executable needed to run Jeff Percival's shadow code to help with calculating observing geometry pointing information.

### [USNO](https://github.com/lenses-lab/LYAO_RT-2018JA026426/tree/master/USNO)
This includes several US Naval Observatory nautical twilight calendars and instructions on how to print your own.
